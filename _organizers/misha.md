[Misha Wolfson](https://myw.github.io/) works on the government team at [Ginkgo Bioworks](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/).
His background is in software engineering and computational biology. He received his Ph.D. in
Physical Chemistry from MIT in 2012, working with Arup Chakraborty on problems at the intersection
of [atomistic simulation](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp202471d), machine learning, and immunology; he
then worked on web-scale healthcare software systems and clinical decision support at athenahealth.
Since coming to Ginkgo in 2015, Misha’s efforts have been focused on applying machine learning and
software engineering to bioinformatics and experimental data analysis. In 2019, he moved full time
to the Government Business Unit, where he works to extend Ginkgo’s problem-solving capabilities to
new areas, such as biosecurity, materials, and space travel.
