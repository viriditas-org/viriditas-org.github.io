20 min talk - 45 min discussion 25 min summary 2 min each table - go through slides on common
document, mic at each table


Ideally, the speakers should keep to a similar structure and gear it towards generating discussion
rather than talking about their specific projects

Moderator - can be Shannon, or different people each time

The talks can have questions but keep them only to a few minute digressions


State goal of the meeting ideally would like to write a review about it, like GP Write


Display constraints and numbers for people to work with back-of-the-envelope if they want, itâ€™s up
to them

Make sure the talks are primers to get everyone on the same page and decrease the risk of a language
disconnect of fields


Live content generation on a single document - presentation/spreadsheet
