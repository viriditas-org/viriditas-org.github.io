Shannon is a postdoctoral fellow in [Pam Silver’s lab at Harvard](https://silver.med.harvard.edu/).
She received her Ph.D. from the University of Washington in Ning Zheng’s lab and studied the
structure biology of circadian clock machinery. Her work at Harvard focuses on the optimization of a
device called the bionic leaf. Briefly, the bionic leaf comprises biocompatible water-splitting
electrodes that provide hydrogen gas to CO<sub>2</sub>-reducing bacteria in a single reactor. She
manipulates the metabolic pathways through genetic engineering to produce bioplastics, biofuels,
feedstocks for heterotrophic microbes, and fertilizers; all with water, CO<sub>2</sub>, and
electricity as the primary inputs. Her prime directive is to use synthetic biology to address the
challenges of <abbr title="In-Situ Resource Utilization">ISRU</abbr> to promote a permanent human
presence beyond Earth.
