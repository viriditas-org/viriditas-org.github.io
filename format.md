   <p>The structure of <i>Viriditas</i> is modeled after the concept of an unconference,
which prioritizes attention and engagement with the partcipants. It will consist of four technical
talks, interspersed with breakout sessions of 8-10 people each to brainstorm ideas along three tracks.</p>

   
 <p>After each talk, the participants can select which track is most interesting and join a breakout
session that focuses on that topic. The sessions will be participant-driven and guided by a
facilitator who will encourage and support contributions from each member. Each group will contribute to a live slide deck to summarize the group's discussion. Please be aware that <b>active participation is strongly encouraged</b>. </p>

 <p>The goal of this workshop is to have lively and productive discussions about tractable steps
necessary to create life-support systems on Mars. We plan to coalesce the thoughts and conclusions
into a review article and white paper that serve as a template for future study. We hope to create a
stronger network of those who seek cross-disciplinary collaborations on the future of space
exploration and that <i>Viriditas</i> will nucleate the formation of a more stable community of
space-inspired biologists. </p>
