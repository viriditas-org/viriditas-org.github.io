Sara Walker is an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist interested in the origin of life and how to find life on other 
worlds. While there are many things to be solved, she is most interested in whether or not there are ‘laws of life’ - related
to how information structures the physical world - that could universally describe life here on Earth and on other planets.
At Arizona State University she is Deputy Director of the Beyond Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science,
Associate Director of the ASU-Santa Fe Institute Center for Biosocial Complex Systems and Associate Professor in the 
School of Earth and Space Exploration. She is also Co-founder of the astrobiology-themed social website SAGANet.org, 
and is a member of the Board of Directors of Blue Marble Space. She is active in public engagement in science, with appearances at the World Science Festival, and on "Through the Wormhole" and NPR's Science Friday.
