                <h4>Misha Wolfson, PhD</h4>
                <p>Misha is a software engineer and computational biologist at Ginkgo Bioworks. He received his PhD in Physical Chemistry in 2012, working on problems at the intersection of atomistic simulation, machine learning, and immunology; he then worked on web-scale healthcare software systems and clinical decision support. Since coming to Ginkgo in 2015, Misha’s efforts have been focused at the intersection of software development and machine learning, applied to experimental data analysis and bioinformatics. He also works with the Government Business Unit at Ginkgo to develop the company’s capabilities to solve problems in developing areas, such as biosecurity and space travel.</p>

                <h4>Ariel Ekblaw</h4>
                <p>Ariel is the founder and lead of the MIT Media Lab’s Space Exploration Initiative, a team of over 50 students, faculty, and staff actively prototyping of our Sci-Fi space future. For the Initiative, Ariel coordinates space research and launch opportunities across the spectrum of science, engineering, art, and design, and builds collaborations on this work with MIT and Space Industry partners. Ariel is simultaneously a graduate research assistant at the MIT Media Lab, where she is completing a PhD in Aerospace Structures in Dr. Joseph Paradiso’s Responsive Environments group. Her current research includes designing, testing, and deploying self-assembling space architecture, for future space tourist habitats and space stations in orbit around the Earth and Mars. Ariel brings an interdisciplinary approach to her research at the Media Lab, with undergraduate degrees in Physics, Mathematics and Philosophy from Yale University and a master’s in blockchain research from MIT. Her past work experience includes blockchain product development, cloud computing analytics at Microsoft Azure, big data programming at the CERN Particle Physics Laboratory, microgravity research with NASA, and Mars2020 rover hardware systems engineering at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Ariel’s work has been featured in AIAA, IEEE, Wired, Ars Technica, MIT Technology Review, Harvard Business Review, the Wall Street Journal, PRI’s ScienceFriday, and more.</p>
