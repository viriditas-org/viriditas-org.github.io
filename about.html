    <p class="card-text">
      Misha is a software engineer and computational biologist at Ginkgo Bioworks. He received his PhD
      in Physical Chemistry in 2012, working on problems at the intersection of atomistic simulation,
      machine learning, and immunology; he then worked on web-scale healthcare software systems and
      clinical decision support. Since coming to Ginkgo in 2015, Misha’s efforts have been focused at
      the intersection of software development and machine learning, applied to experimental data
      analysis and bioinformatics. He also works with the Government Business Unit at Ginkgo to
      develop the company’s capabilities to solve problems in developing areas, such as biosecurity
      and space travel.
