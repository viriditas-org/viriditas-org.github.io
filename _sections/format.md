We strive to maximize information exchange and will prioritize discussion and engagement of all
participants. Participants will be sorted into groups based on their expertise and interests. Each
group will be mediated by a facilitator. Similar to a hackathon, over the course of the day, the
groups will generate a hypothetical project plan to accomplish their goals. Periodic checkpoints
will break up the sessions to guide and focus progress. The day will end in a keynote and reception.

The goal of this workshop is to have lively and productive discussions about tractable steps
necessary to create life-support systems on Mars. Please be aware that <span
class="text-primary">**active participation is strongly encouraged**</span>. We plan to coalesce the
thoughts and conclusions into additional publications that drive future planning and engineering
efforts. We hope to strengthen the network of those who seek cross-disciplinary collaborations on
the future of space exploration and that Viriditas will nucleate the formation of a more stable
community of space-inspired biologists.
