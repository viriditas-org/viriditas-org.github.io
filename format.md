The structure of _Viriditas_ is modeled after the concept of an
[unconference](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003905&type=printable),
which prioritizes attention and engagement with the partcipants. It will consist of four technical
talks, interspersed with breakout sessions of 8 -- 10 people each to brainstorm ideas.

Brainstorms will occur along three tracks:
1. _Martian Resources and Environment_
2. _Genetic Engineering_ 
3. _Closing the Loop on Life-support Systems_

After each talk, the participants can select which track is most interesting and join a breakout
session that focuses on that topic. The sessions will be discussion-driven and guided by a
facilitator who will encourage and support contributions from each member; please be aware that
*active participation is strongly encouraged*.

[Something here about how sessions will contribute to a slide presentation/take notes]

The goal of this workshop is to have lively and productive discussions about tractable steps
necessary to create life-support systems on Mars. We plan to coalesce the thoughts and conclusions
into a review article and white paper that serve as a template for future study. We hope to create a
stronger network of those who seek cross-disciplinary collaborations on the future of space
exploration and that _Viriditas_ will nucleate the formation of a more stable community of
space-inspired biologists.
