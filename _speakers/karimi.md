Dr. Tara Karimi is the co-founder and CEO of [Cemvita Factory](https://www.cemvitafactory.com/),
which is a Houston-based Biotech company with the focus of in-space biomanufacturing of human
life-supplies. Dr. Karimi started her research in biochemistry and after finishing her Ph.D., she
ventured into stem-cell-based regenerative medicine. She completed two post-doc programs in
collaboration with Tulane University, Texas Heart Institutes (THI), Methodist Hospital and the
University of South Carolina. She has always been passionate about the evolution of life among
different organisms and has a Ph.D. in veterinary medicine as well.  

The introduction to biochemistry was the onset of her journey into multidisciplinary sciences, as
she completed several projects in genetic engineering of stem cells, developmental and
molecular biology, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. As part of these endeavors,
she worked on the genetic programming of stem cells for differentiation towards pacemaker and
Purkinje cells as a therapeutic approach for treatment of cardiac arrhythmia. In other projects,
she worked on bioengineering of osteoarticular tissues applying developmentally inspired
methods. Dr. Karimi is also the author of a recent Springer book titled _Molecular Mechanisms
of Autonomy in Biological Systems by the Relativity of Code, Energy, and Mass_.

This broad exposure and passion for the evolution and origin of life motivated her to establish
Cemvita Factory with the mission of applying methods of bioengineering for in-space habitation
and biomanufacturing of human life-supplies.
