Tara Karimi is the founder and CEO of Cemvita Factory Inc. She has devoted her academic career to studying biological systems and applying the natural principles to create biologically-inspired technology. Dr. Karimi started her research in veterinary medicine, and from there ventured into biochemistry. The introduction to biochemistry was the onset of her journey into multidisciplinary science as she  completed several projects in tissue engineering, genetic engineering, molecular and developmental biology, stem cell research, and regenerative medicine. As part of these endeavors she genetically programmed stem cells to differentiate to insulin producing cells as an alternative method for insulin injection for diabetes patients. She also programmed stem cells to generate pacemaker and purkinjie cells as an alternative for electronic pacemakers for treatment of arrhythmia. 

This broad exposure and passion for the chemistry of living systems allowed her to connect the dots in biology and chemistry to pioneer what she calls cognitive chemistry. She is also the author of the upcoming Springer book titled “Molecular Mechanisms of Autonomy in Biological Systems by the Relativity of Code, Energy, and Mass”. Dr. Karimi received her Doctor in Veterinary Medicine & PhD in Biochemistry from Shiraz University, her Postdoc in Tissue Engineering from University of South Carolina and Postdoc in Stem Cell Programming from Tulane University.
