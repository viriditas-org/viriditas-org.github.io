The structure of the workshop is modeled after the concept of an [unconference](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003905&type=printable), which prioritize attention and engagement with the partcipants. It will comprise four technical talks interspersed with breakout sessions of groups of 8-10 people to brainstorm ideas. It will be discussion driven so please be aware that active participation is strongly encouraged.

The goal of this workshop is to have lively and productive discussions about tractable steps necessary to create life-support systems on Mars. We plan to coalesce the thoughts and conclusions into a review article and white paper that would serve as a template for future study. We hope to create a stronger network of those who seek cross-disciplinary collaborations on the future of space exploration. We hope that this workshop will nucleate the formation of a more stable community of space-inspired biologists.
