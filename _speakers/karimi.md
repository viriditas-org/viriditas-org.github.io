Dr. Tara Karimi is the co-founder and CEO of Cemvita Factory which is a Houston-based
Biotech company with the focus of in-space biomanufacturing of human life-supplies. Dr. Karimi
started her research in Biochemistry and after finished her Ph.D., she ventured into stem cell-
based regenerative medicine. She completed two post-doc programs in collaboration with
Tulane University, Texas Heart Institutes (THI), Methodist Hospital and University of South
Carolina. She always has been passionate about the evolution of life among different organisms
and has a Ph.D. in veterinary medicine, as well.  

The introduction to biochemistry was the onset of her journey into multidisciplinary sciences. As
she completed several projects in genetic engineering of stem cells, developmental and
molecular biology, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. As part of these endeavors,
she worked on the genetic programming of stem cells for differentiation towards Pacemaker and
Purkinje cells as a therapeutic approach for treatment of cardiac arrhythmia. In other projects,
she worked on bioengineering of osteoarticular tissues applying developmentally inspired
methods. Dr. Karimi is also the author of a recent Springer book titled “Molecular Mechanisms
of Autonomy in Biological Systems by the Relativity of Code, Energy, and Mass”.

This broad exposure and passion for the evolution and origin of life motivated her to establish
Cemvita Factory with the mission of applying methods of bioengineering for in-space habitation
and biomanufacturing of human life-supplies.
