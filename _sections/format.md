The structure of *Viriditas* is modeled after the concept of an [unconference](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003905),
which prioritizes attention and engagement with the partcipants. It will consist of four technical
talks, interspersed with breakout sessions of 8 -- 10 people each to brainstorm ideas along three
tracks.

After each talk, the participants can select which track is most interesting and join a breakout
session that focuses on that topic. The sessions will be participant-driven and guided by a
facilitator who will encourage and support contributions from each member. Each group will
contribute to a live slide deck to summarize the group's discussion. Please be aware that
<span class="text-primary">**active participation is strongly encouraged**</span>.

The goal of this workshop is to have lively and productive discussions about tractable steps
necessary to create life-support systems on Mars. We plan to coalesce the thoughts and conclusions
into a review article and white paper that serve as a template for future study. We hope to create a
stronger network of those who seek cross-disciplinary collaborations on the future of space
exploration and that *Viriditas* will nucleate the formation of a more stable community of
space-inspired biologists.
