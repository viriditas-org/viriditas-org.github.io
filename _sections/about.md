### We need a plan, and we need it now.

Viriditas is a focused, discussion-based workshop geared towards coalescing a practical plan for a
sustainable settlement on Mars. Resulting from its [inaugural meeting in 2018](/2018), we published a
Perspective in **Journal TBD** framing the problem. This year, we will back out approaches and
designs that can be implemented in the first crewed missions to Mars circa 2040. We see many
parallels between a sustainable Mars and sustainable Earth and will bias discussion toward efforts
that support the long-term interests of both planets, ideally by engaging Earth markets to bootstrap
Martian infrastructure.

The workshop will be a full-day event on November 20<sup>th</sup>, 2019 at the [Hyatt Regency Boston](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/massachusetts/hyatt-regency-boston/bosto)

Viriditas is a joint effort by the AIChE, Ouroboros Biomanufacturing, Ginkgo Bioworks, and the MIT
Media Lab Space Exploration Initiative. For further information, please see the [Organizers](#organizers) and
[Sponsors](#sponsors) sections of the site.

The name _Viriditas_ is inspired from a concept in Kim Stanley Robinson's [_Mars Trilogy_](https://www.kimstanleyrobinson.info/content/mars-trilogy):

  All these conditions make survival for living things difficult in the extreme. But
  life is tough and adaptable, it is the green force viriditas, pushing into the universe.
